### Oxidizing Firefox
	
#### The journey of Rust and Stylo within Firefox

<small> &mdash; Manish Goregaokar (@Manishearth)</small>

♫
Hi! I'm Manish; I work on Servo at Mozilla.

I'm here to talk about our journey integrating Rust code into Firefox.

§
### Firefox (Gecko)

 - 9M lines of C++ code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Browsers take in code over the internet and do all kinds of stuff with it <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Huge attack surface <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


♫

So, Firefox.

Like all mainstream browsers, Firefox's engine, Gecko, is written in C++. A lot of it.

Browsers are something which take in arbitrary code over the Internet and do a lot of things with it. This means they have a huge attack surface.

Browsers are no stranger to memory safety issues; and despite using a lot of best practices they continue to be plagued by them. Roughly half of the security issues in Firefox have been memory safety related.


§

<img src=img/rust-logo-blk.svg width="50%">

♫

This isn't a great situation. But this is why we have Rust!


§
<img src=img/rust-logo-blk.svg width="20%">


 - Systems language <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Memory safe <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Avoids compromising on speed <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Relatively easy to write multithreaded code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

♫

Rust was started within Mozilla as a safe systems language. As a ¶ systems language, it's suited for building things like browsers.

It's ¶ memory safe, which means that it attempts to rule out the existence of memory safety bugs within the vast majority of your codebase.

It does this ¶ without compromising on speed; which again makes it very suited for browsers.

Finally, its memory safety protections help for ¶ thread safety as well. This makes it rather easy to write multithreaded code.

We usually frame this as "Fearless Concurrency", because this makes it possible to aggressively
write concurrent code and have the compiler help prevent the kind of mistakes that are easy to make
when threads are involved.

§
### Servo

 - ~400k (~1.5M with dependencies) lines of Rust code
 - Highly parallel
 - Experimental.

♫

Enter Servo. Servo is an experimental browser engine in Rust. It's significantly smaller than Gecko
and doesn't yet do everything, but it serves well for experimentation.

Servo is mostly in Rust which makes it relatively memory safe.

But it makes heavy use of Rust's "fearless concurrency" as well! Browsers traditionally have been very single-threaded;
each tab will have a single thread which does most of the work. Networking and certain rendering things can be off the main thread
but overall browsers don't make use of the hardware we have for the computationally intensive stuff.

Servo has parallel layout, parallel styling, and offloads almost all the rendering work to the GPU; which leads to major performance wins.

§
### Oxidation

Let's actually bring this to Firefox!

♫

As Rust stabilized there was growing interest in bringing some of these wins into Firefox. Thus started the "oxidation" project; for getting Rust code into Firefox.

§
### Initial hurdles

 - General immaturity
 - Platform support
 - Cargo very opinionated

♫

There were a lot of issues getting this to work initially. Rust was pretty immature at the time; it
had only recently stabilized as a language. There were also platform support issues; e.g. debug info
didn't work well on Windows; and there were thread issues on older versions.

Cargo required the network to exist to work; which wasn't something we could have in our build system.

§
### Baby steps

 - URL parser <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - MP4 metadata parser <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

♫

Initially folks started this by experimentation. Someone taught Firefox to use Rust's ¶ URL parser as
an experiment. This process brought out many of the deficiencies that Rust had at the time, and we
got those fixed.

A larger project started to use a Rust ¶ parser for a certain new format of metadata in MP4 headers. This was
the first Rust code to end up in a Firefox release. The nice thing about this was that it could be turned off;
if we didn't have Rust support on a platform we could just not parse that kind of MP4 file.
This meant we could experiment and get real data but also not force all the Rust infrastructure pieces to be in place up front. It also
let us do a gradual rollout in case things went wrong. They didn't.

§
### Stylo!

 ~160K lines of C++ -> ~85k lines of Rust

♫

Now, these were relatively small projects, and mostly helped push Rust support in Firefox to the level we needed to work on larger things.

And thus started Stylo. This was a project to take Servo's Rust style system and put it inside Gecko.

The "style system" is our term for the component of the browser engine that parses the CSS, matches
rules to elements, and goes through the "cascade", where we determine the most applicable rule and
"compute" a style for the given element.

It's a highly top-down process; you need to calculate the style of a parent element to calculate the
styles of its children, but these styles can often then be calculated independently. This is _great_
for parallelism; and we make use of this. While Servo's style system used to use a hand-rolled work-
stealing algorithm, we now use the framework provided by rayon, a Rust library that makes it easy
to do work-stealing parallelism.

Integrating Stylo was a lot more challenging than the Rust projects that had happened before.

§
The Web is dark and full of terrors, and Servo doesn't yet
implement all of them.

♫
For one, Servo's style system was incomplete. The Web is dark and full of terrors, and Servo doesn't yet
implement all of them. A few months ago I wrote a three thousand word blog post about how complex
the font-size CSS property is _alone_. A lot of stuff like this was missing in Servo. This meant there was a lot of work to fill in the gaps.



§

### September 2016
<img src=img/stylo-obama.png width="80%">

♫

This is what Wikipedia looked like after around half a year of work by a small team.


§
### Today
<img src=img/stylo-obama2.png width="80%">


♫

And it took us another year with a much bigger team to get all the CSS features in place.

(Wikipedia started looking almost-correct much before we had everything implemented, but it was still a rather large period of time)


§
Frankenstein's browser
♫

Another problem was that browsers are rather monolithic. "Style system" isn't a standalone component; it's just an approximate set
of functionality that we gave a name to. This means there was no clean API boundary, we had to pick a spot to tear the style system out, and
try to sew it back onto the other browser.

All the previous rust integrations had clean, hand-written bindings, with perhaps a couple dozen FFI functions declared. Stylo needed to understand everything about
storing computed styles on the C++-side structs, and there would be a significant FFI back-and-forth between the style system and Gecko.

This is nearly impossible to do by hand.

§
<img src=img/bindgen.png width="80%">

♫

Enter bindgen.

Bindgen is a tool that when given a body of header files will generate Rust-side structs and FFI function bindings.

This lets us not have to worry about keeping updated bindings. We can write to C++-side structs from Rust code almost
seamlessly, and call functions defined by C/C++ as well.

§

```c
/// in C
bool Gecko_IsInDocument(RawGeckoNodeBorrowed node);
```

```
/// in Rust
extern "C" {
 pub fn Gecko_IsInDocument (node: RawGeckoNodeBorrowed)
     -> bool; 
}
```

♫

For example, it converts this C function declaration to this bit of Rust code

§

```cpp
/// In C++
struct nsStyleFont
{

  nsFont  mFont;
  nscoord mSize;
  float mFontSizeFactor;
  nscoord mFontSizeOffset;
  uint8_t mFontSizeKeyword;
  uint8_t mGenericID;
  // ...
  RefPtr<nsAtom> mLanguage;
};

```

♫

And converts this C++ struct

§

```rust
/// In Rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct nsStyleFont {
    pub mFont: nsFont,
    pub mSize: nscoord,
    pub mFontSizeFactor: f32,
    pub mFontSizeOffset: nscoord,
    pub mFontSizeKeyword: u8,
    pub mGenericID: u8,
    // ...
    pub mLanguage: RefPtr<nsAtom>,
}
```

♫

To this Rust one.

§

 - `Gecko_` functions are defined in C++ and called from Rust
 - `Servo_` functions are defined in Rust and called by C++

♫

We have some conventions to help. Whilst bindgen doesn't exactly help with generating C++-side declarations for Rust functions,
what we do is that we declare the Servo_ functions in a C++ header file, and bindgen generates bindings for these; and then we
have a unit test that ensures that the functions in the generated bindings have the same types as the actual Rust functions we've defined.

§

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn Servo_AnimationValues_IsInterpolable(from: RawServoAnimationValueBorrowed,
                                                       to: RawServoAnimationValueBorrowed)
                                                       -> bool {
    let from_value = AnimationValue::as_arc(&from);
    let to_value = AnimationValue::as_arc(&to);
    from_value.animate(to_value, Procedure::Interpolate { progress: 0.5 }).is_ok()
}
```

♫

Here's one example of a Rust-side function that C++ calls, to see if it is possible to interpolate between two values.

§

### Safety

 - FFI is inherently unsafe <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Lots of FFI is bad <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - We need lots of FFI <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Worth it? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

♫

So Rust has a concept of "unsafe". While normal Rust code is memory safe; Rust gives you the power to turn this off for regions of your code.

This is useful for implementing low level datastructures (like a growable vector), and for calling FFI functions, where there's no guarantee that the other end will do something safe.

Anyway, ¶ FFI is inherently unsafe. As a corollar, ¶ lots of FFI is bad.

But ¶ we need lots of FFI, because we didn't have a clean API surface.

¶ Is it worth it? The safety hazards in the FFI may outweigh the benefits of writing it in a safe language. Then we're back to square one.

In our experience: It was worth it.

We also had a bunch of tricks to make things safer.



§

<img src=img/nsstring.png width="80%">

♫

For example, Gecko uses a complicated set of custom string types. By default dealing with them from Rust involves a lot
of unsafe pointer manipulation, but we implemented methods on it that did this so that one could use it safely from Rust.

We did similar things for array types and many other gecko-side structs that needed to be manipulated often.



§

```c
/// RawGeckoNodeBorrowed[OrNull] is `GeckoNode const*`
RawGeckoNodeBorrowedOrNull
	Gecko_GetLastChild(RawGeckoNodeBorrowed node);
```

```rust
extern "C" {
	fn Gecko_GetLastChild(node: &GeckoNode) -> Option<&GeckoNode>;
}
```

♫

We also told bindgen to to lots of type substitution. For example, we had typedefs tagged as "borrowed" and "borrowed or null". On the C++ side they were
simply pointers, but on the Rust side bindgen would replace `FooBorrowed` with a borrowed pointer to `Foo` and `FooBorrowedOrNull` with `Option<&Foo>`. `Option<&T>` is represented
as a single word where the `None` variant is represented by null. This reduced the number of things we had to worry about at the FFI layer. There are many invariants to
uphold, but at least null and dangling pointers will not be problems.


Generally, we customize bindgen a _lot_, we were giving it so many configuration options that we
eventually created a 600-line toml file for storing the higher-level configuration in a structured
format. Bindgen is highly configurable in what it can produce and this is a very powerful tool to have.

Bindgen can also cope a lot with C++ stuff, including generating bindings for methods and many
things. We didn't make as much use of this as we could have (due to various reasons that are mostly
no longer valid).


§
### Thread safety

 - Stylo is very parallel
 - Gecko is designed around there being one main thread for a content process
 - Every time we call into gecko there's a danger of this breaking down


♫

Rust makes it easy to avoid threadsafety issues in Rust code. But we can't extend that to the C++ code we call. Gecko wasn't designed with parallelism in mind, so many of the function calls we do
assume that they're being called from the "main" thread and do various things with globals.

For a while we'd stumble across one of these every few weeks, and it would take a nontrivial amount
of time to fix. For me this was in fact the best argument for using Rust for Stylo; if our
occasional Rust-to-C++ calls have so much trouble with thread safety it would have been much much
worse for a pure C++ project to make it parallel. (In fact, there have been not one but two unsuccessful
projects in the past for writing a parallel style system in C++)

We eventually designed a fix, however.

§
### Static analysis

 - GCC plugin
 - Detect writes to the heap stemming from `Gecko_` functions
 - System of whitelists helps with "allowed" writes

♫

We designed a static analysis that would prevent heap writes from `Gecko_` functions.
Either a `Gecko_` function would assert that it was on the main thread, or its
callgraph would be enforced to write only to non-heap variables. We could whitelist
pointer arguments to these functions as "local", as well as whitelist certain library
calls as safe.

This significantly improved the situation of thread safety.

§
### Infra hurdles

 - Vendoring crates
 - Build time bindgen
 - Dual monorepo

♫

Aside from the code-side challenges, we also had some infrastructure level challenges. As mentioned before,
Cargo hits the network to fetch crates, which we can't allow in our testing environment. We worked on getting
vendoring support into cargo, so that now it's easy to check in all your dependencies into the tree and work with them.

We also used to check in bindings and manually regenerate them. This was fine during development, but it was unacceptable
for anything that is being released. All the safety of Stylo will be worthless if someone forgets to accompany
a relevant header file change with a bindings regen, leading to mismatched layouts and lots of unsafety. Also,
this meant we couldn't generate platform-dependent bindings (e.g. bindings to statics) or work on 32 bit at all.

Bindgen uses libclang, and getting that working well in automation was tricky, but we did it and switched over to generating
bindings at build time.

Finally, both Gecko and Servo are their own repositories. Gecko follows a monorepo format, and Servo is a multirepo with
a very large "core browser" repo at the top. While a large fraction of our code is not in the core browser repo, the style system was.

We wanted to continue to be able to hack on servo on its own, but we also wanted to be able to coordinate landing of patches
that apply to both codebases. The solution was to vendor servo inside Gecko, but keep it a separate repo as well, with commits from
Servo being mirrored in. There's a lot of scope for improvement here with more automation.


§
The benefits

♫
So I've gone on for a while about all the challenges we had and how we tackled them.

But it was completely worth it!

§
### Benefit: Speed

<img src=img/amazon.png width="80%">

♫

One benefit was that Firefox did get noticeably faster. This graph (note the truncated y-axis) shows a 25%
speedup in the time it takes to load Amazon's homepage. While I don't have numbers for this, many noticed that sites like
Twitter and Google Maps were much more responsive with Stylo enabled.

Parallelism is pretty great!

§
### Benefit: Safety

 - Despite all the churn, not much in the world of memory safety bugs
 - Intensive fuzzing mostly caught panics (assertions)
 - Much easier to do refactorings safely

♫

The new codebase is much safer, too. We haven't had that many safety issues, and the ones we have had have been on the C++ side due to refactorings we had to do to accomodate stylo.

We fuzzed the new code a _lot_, and unlike the usual output of fuzzing, we mostly found regular Rust panics; i.e. assertions. These would
cause the process to exit on a release build, but would not be exploitable unlike memory safety bugs.

I personally found it much easier to refactor the Rust code. I recall once when there was an
involved C++ side refactoring that I had to do, and my initial estimate was 3 days. I was extremely
wrong. This wasn't because I didn't know C++; I've been writing C++ far longer than Rust; it was
because I was in a Rust mindset and it would probably have taken me that long if it was in pure
Rust. I had to work very carefully to structure my changes such that the chances for breaking
pointery things was low in each step. Planning this itself took time. Doing each step also took
quite a while. Segfaults still happened each step, and debugging them was a pain. It ultimately took me three weeks
to get it done, far from my estimate of three days. On the other hand the Rust side of the refactor which
involved a lot of the same kinds of changes was done quickly because I just had to make some changes and fix up
all the compiler errors one by one.

§
### Benefit: Cleaner code

 - Stronger types and abstractions
 - `#[derive()]`

♫

Not just from the point of view of safety, but in general I found the new code much cleaner.
Admitteldly, some of this may have been possible to achieve by just a targeted rewrite in C++. For example, Rust traits were
quite useful for keeping the code compartmentalized and understandable. Rust enums are really good
for representing CSS. Overall, it was much more pleasant to work with.

Rust custom derives deserve a mention here; too. While Gecko uses a pile of C macros and mostly hand-written parsing/computation/animation
code, we were able to make all that unnecessary using Rust's custom derive functionality, which let us do
a lot of codegen at compile time.

§
### General tips for integrating Rust

 - Try to keep a manageable API surface <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Reach for `bindgen` when the API surface gets large enough <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Choose stuff where Rust will benefit you <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

♫

A lot of the challeges I mentioned are rather specific to Stylo. In general, if you want to integrate Rust into an existing codebase,

¶ try to keep a manageable API surface. For stylo it was inevitable that we would have no clean API; but in most cases you can choose something that
will get you a manageable API. Keep the bindings in mind when deciding the scope of the integration.

¶ You should also reach for bindgen the minute the bindings get large. As I've mentioned bindgen has
a lot of features and knobs, explore them and try to exploit them to your advantage. If bindgen
doesn't handle some C++ stuff you need; file an issue, the maintainers are pretty responsive.

¶ Finally, try to choose stuff where Rust will benefit you. There is always a safety cost of the FFI you have to do; make sure the benefits of Rust outweigh the safety cost of the FFI.

§
### Where Rust shines

 - Optimizing hot codepaths in Python/Ruby/etc programs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Parallelizing stuff <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - When memory safety is a problem <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - If you just find Rust easier to work with! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


♫

As a Rust programmer I'd like to urge folks to just write _everything_ in Rust, but I suspect not everyone is as enthusiastic as I am :)

¶ Rust is really good for optimizing perf-critical codepaths in programs in interpreted languages. This was somewhat unexpected for us, but one of the major
uses of Rust in production is for stuff like this. We've gotten consistent feedback from these companies that folks who are new to systems programming find Rust a very good way to learn.

¶ As I've mentioned it's also good for writing code that makes use of parallelism.

¶ This goes without saying, but if your native codebase needs protection against memory safety bugs, Rust is great.

¶ Opinions differ on whether Rust is easier to use than C++ or other languages, but if your team
finds it so; go for it! Rust is generally applicable to a rather wide set of use cases, and more
or less all the cases where you can also use C++.
